/*
 * The basic idea of patience diff is to find lines that are unique in
 * both files.  These are intuitively the ones that we want to see as
 * common lines.
 *
 * The maximal ordered sequence of such line pairs (where ordered means
 * that the order in the sequence agrees with the order of the lines in
 * both files) naturally defines an initial set of common lines.
 *
 * Now, the algorithm tries to extend the set of common lines by growing
 * the line ranges where the files have identical lines.
 *
 * Between those common lines, the patience diff algorithm is applied
 * recursively, until no unique line pairs can be found; these line ranges
 * are handled by the well-known Myers algorithm.
